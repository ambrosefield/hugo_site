British Composer

**Ambrose Field**'s music has been described as "Mesmerising and
beautiful" by ClassicFM magazine, featuring "Interlocking tonal
nuances of fragile beauty, without equal"  (JazzEcho.de) and as being
"Completely Compelling" by BBC Music. His pieces combine lush
harmonic soundscapes with a focused, contemporary aesthetic. Field's
work has been performed at The Vienna Konzerthaus,
Parco Della Musica, Rome, The Chicago Early Music Festival, Perth
Festival, Australia, Dancity Festival, Italy and the Los Angeles
Convention Centre. He has been a resident composer at Hungarian
National Radio (supported by UNESCO), Recombinant Media Labs San
Francisco, and the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Canada. His
album _Being Dufay_, is recorded on ECM records (ECM 2071) and is
distributed by Universal. It toured to 13 nations as a live
performance.

Field writes for instruments, choirs, and electronic
media. His music has been commissioned widely for concert performance
and for immersive media applications. The large-scale vocal piece _Pod Twoją
obronę_ (25 voices, one-to-a-part) for the Polish National Chamber
Choir Polski Chor Kameralny is a monolithic vocal soundscape of
sculptural proportions and was specifically commissioned to honour the
80th Birthday Anniversary of notable Polish composer H. M. Górecki .
For his work with technology, he is a three-time recipient of the
honorary award at the Prix Ars Electronica, Linz, and has received
international performances including in the RML Cinechamber at MUTEK,
Canada, 2014. Interdisciplinary creative questions underpin his
output. Field's series of architecturally informed compositions
_Architexture_ make use of specific acoustics of a site to inform how
a score is crafted. The technically challenging cycle of pieces for
solo flute _Quantaform Series_, which re-thinks the relationship
between performer and environment, is to be the subject of a new film
made with support of the Arts Council UK and National Lottery Heritage
Fund (2019). He has collaborated with researchers in other disciplines
(sculpture, health science, education, heritage), worked as industrial
consultant to media companies and technology firms, acted as
investigator and co-investigator on research grants, and served as a
jury member for national and international composition competitions.

Ambrose is presently interim Dean of Arts and Humanities at the University of York, UK,
where he was previously Head of Department of Music from 2013. Field was appointed to Honorary Professorships at the Beijing Institute for
Advanced Innovation, and China National School of Music, China
Conservatory in 2018.
