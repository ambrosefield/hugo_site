## About the work {#about-the-work}

_Frozen Reflection, Sleeping Buffalo_ uses EBows - electromechanical resonating devices, not as drones in their own right, but to provoke delaicate and unusual timbres from sustained piano chords. The EBows continually vibrate a string as if it had infinate sustain (and are often used by guitarists for this purpose). The piano pedal in this work forms a kind of 'envelope' control, opening up and closing down this resonance. The sounds made by the EBows modlate the chords played by the pianist, creating a shimmering haze of harmonics. The drone itself blends into the background, creating a kind of horizon in the sound landscape around which everything else circulates.

## Arctic cold {#arctic-cold}

It's late December. Air from the Arctic drifts slowly over Alberta, and temperatures reach a chilling minus 30 degrees Celsius. _Frozen Reflection Sleeping Buffalo_ is inspired by the First Nations Legend of Sleeping Buffalo. The piece stems from a period working as an artist at the Banff Centre for the Arts and Innovation, Canada, in Dec 2016. My project at the time was to work on a large-scale orchestral commission. However, whilst doing so I discovered a design method which could combine fixed external resonances with my own choice of colours.


## Ebow sounds {#ebow-sounds}

The Ebows produce a kind of etherial constant drone sound, but
interestingly, also _modulate_ the decay of the other sounds. You can
hear a shimmering quality to the sustains as a result of this aural
effect. After realising this, I decided to compose these effects into
the piece by finding harmonies and textures which would provoke them.

Using EBows on the piano can be a challenge, as other composers have
found. The strings to be a low-tension enough to be able to vibrate by
the effects of a magnetic field, yet not so thick that they are too
heavy to move. This limits the range over which you can place them on
the piano. The results are slightly different for different pianos too.
After much experimentation, I settled on a range of C4 - REFERENCE.


## Musical structure {#musical-structure}

I've been working with on idea of designing a _musical surface_, rather
than accepting a 'surface' (here taken to mean the totality of the
sounding result) as a consequence of other design processes. Composing
this way is a bit like sculpting a large block of granite in order to
unconvering the form. It's subtractive. In this music, different parts
of the surface fades in and out of focus over time. Harmonic centres of
importance are spread over the piece so that they become exposed and
then gradually subside throughout the piece. Here's a visualisation:

## Organisation {#organisation}

_Frozen Reflection Sleeping Buffalo_ has two sections. In the first,
small, isolated moments are set against a continuity of delicate drones
provided by the Ebows. Tiny changes in the resonance of the decay occur
as the ebow drones interfere with the other pitches to produce
modulation artefacts. In order to design these more carefully than in my
initial experiements, I needed to model these acoustic effects in Open
Music (see below).

The second section is a reversal, or reflection of the first in almost
every way. Instead of building harmony on top of drone-like resonances
as previously, I wanted to gradually fill out the negative-space around
the drone-sounds is inverted with dense, angular chromatic writing.

The piano chords appear to take on a transparent, shimmering quality
during these silences-in-sound.

## Tunnel Mountain {#tunnel-mountain}

In the First Nations legend Tunnel mountain is a sacred place. It is a place where people come to share knowledge and
discover new bonds to their surroundings and culture. Then they leave.
