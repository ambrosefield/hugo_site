2019 | Scores for a rehearsal process


## Information {#information}

A series of pieces where the musicians structure an off-line
design process themselves. The score describes these activities, rather than a performance.

> The performers credit themselves as composers for these pieces under a creative commons license.


### Scoring the rehearsal process, not the performance {#scoring-the-rehearsal-process-not-the-performance}

The purpose of this work is to investigate what a score for a 'rehearsal process' might be (rather than a score aimed at a 'realisation' of a 'performance'.) A parametric, modular score is given where musicans are encouraged to think about the _workflow of a design process_, rather than to generate sound in a responsive manner to visual stiumuli.

Whilst plenty of scores from Medieval Music to Open Form composition address the challenges of creatively empowering performers, few address the actual rehearsal process itself: the _when_ and _why_ of collaborative decision making _whilst in the act of assembling a piece_. _Self-Assembly Unit_ series of pieces explores these questions.

### on timelines and improvisation {#on-timelines-and-improvisation}

Timelines are often seen as restrictive by improvisors, and graphic score, whilst open-ended, still offers the possibility that the interpretation of even the most abstract visuals will be measured against the works previously made by a particular composer, or failing that, within a broader tradition to which the graphics might be perceived to belong. I wanted to reject both of these notions, by turing over the timeline construction as an explicit and defined process to the musicians, in such a way that the process of assembly here has both real-time, and _off-line_ elements to it.


### Modular score {#modular-score}

Self-Assembly Unit Series is inspired by authorship debates and flatpack furniture. Self-Assembly Unit is a series of modular works which include the basic ingredients from which a piece might be rehearsed.


### Reproducable research {#reproducable-research}

In research, reproducable-research means that it is possible to inspect the working (generally: code, raw data, processing methods) behind the conclusions presented. I wanted to expose the 'internals' of a composition process to performers, and structure _how_ the assembly of elements is made. To do this, all the internal elements that go into _the process of_ making up a piece are exposed to the musicians, for change and modification. This is a different way of working to, for example, improvising around a stimulus, as longer-term structural decision making is required to define a collaborative sequence of events. _Self Assembly Unit_ is a score for the _workflow_ of assembly.


### Do I call you performers or composers? {#do-i-call-you-performers-or-composers}

_Self assembly unit_ makes no assumptions about a performance occurring from the score in real-time: there is no sense of 'realisation' (in a performative sense) here. Instead, design relationships are suggested around which the performer can generate a complex web of materials. This score then is entirely off-line and non-realtime. It also has nothing to do with the _act_ of performance either, although it prepares the way for this. If you are _musicians_ - a term encompassing performers and composers, then what am I? I'm happy with the idea of being _desginer_ for this piece. I've set the overall parameters, but the workflow of creativity is up to you.
