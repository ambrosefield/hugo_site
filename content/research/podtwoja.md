Pod Twoją Obronę (2013) | for 25 solo voices | Recorded live in Gdansk <br> Conductor: Jan Łukaszewski
{{< youtube id="-eAPAleUSVw" >}}

Pod Twoją Obronę was commissioned by the Polish National Chamber Choir _Polski Chor Kameralny_ to mark the 80th birthday anniversary of composer Henryk Górecki. <br>

This work matches the large, resonant acoustics of the Kościół św. Katarzyny in Gdansk (in which the piece was performed) to the detailed part writing which occurs within the piece. Unlike the works in the [architexture series]({{< ref "archproject.md" >}}), which are written from an evidence base created through acoustic impulse-response analysis, _Pod Twoją Obronę_ relies on straightforward dimensions and materials measurements of the venue (made remotely) to inform the rates at which textures overlap and momentary vocal clarity can be achieved.

You can listen to the results of the live recording (taken from the premier of performance in Gdansk) in the video clip above.
