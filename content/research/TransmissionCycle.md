40 minutes | String quartet and solo Tenor | 2014

An epic journey in sound, starting from simple premises, with melodic threads slowly unwinding unbroken over the course of 40 minutes. The piece is scored for amplifed string quartet and solo tenor. The string lines build slowly then fade in and out of focus, creating a shimmering haze of harmony above which the tenor line floats.  Fragments of text from Ovid's _Metamorphosis_ are delivered as if they were part of a distant news broadcast.

The premier was performed by _The Romanian Quartet_: Mihai Balabas, violin; Marina Pingulescu, violin; Maria Coltatu, viola; Corina Ciuplea, cello, with John Potter, Tenor.

"Along with the subtle sequencing of harmonies, the reflecting sound surfaces brought ebbing melodicism out in the generous space created by the recitative tenor line.. poignant"
ADRIANA CARCU, _All about Jazz_ review

Transmission Cycle, and an interview, was broadcast on Romanian TV.

## Structure and Design considerations {#structure-and-design-considerations}

The piece represents the first large-scale work where I was specifically thinking about the effect the acoustic would have on the performance. Although this pre-dates pieces such as _Architexture I_ for ten-part choir and _Quantaform Series_ for solo flute which use measurement techniques to help bind the piece to the acoustic of the venue, _Transmission Cycle_ leaves time and space for the acoustic to become a performer too, creating floating suspensions and drones whilst the musicians move on to other materials. Harmonically, the work also represented a pivotal moment: I was at this point testing my new thinking on _Designing Music as a Surface_ where lines are sculpted out from larger blocks of material. During this work you can also hear the surroundings for these lines, as if they were silent actors in the performance through the gaps and spaces that are left behind. It's a kind of acoustic subtractive synthesis in this case.
