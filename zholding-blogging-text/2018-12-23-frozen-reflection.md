### Piano Solo with resonating devices

## Arctic cold
It's late December. Air from the Arctic drifts slowly over Alberta, and temperatures reach a chilling minus 30 degrees Celsius. _Frozen Reflection Sleeping Buffalo_ is inspired by the First Nations Legend of Sleeping Buffalo. The piece stems from a period working as an artist at the Banff Centre for the Arts and Innovation, Canada, in Dec 2016.

My project at the time was to work on a large-scale orchestral commission. However, whilst doing so I discovered a design method which could combine fixed external resonances with my own choice of colours.



### EBows

In _Frozen Reflection Sleeping Buffalo_ I'm using mechanical resonating devices *EBows*  placed inside the piano. These are changed and removed during the piece. EBows are often used by guitarists for creating a sense of 'inifinate sustain'. Instead, I'm using them on the piano to generate a feeling of a 'horizon' (functioning as a fixed point of reference) in the music, and for some special acoustic effects you can create with them.

### Ebow sounds
The Ebows produce a kind of etherial constant drone sound, but interestingly, also _modulate_ the decay of the other sounds. You can hear a shimmering quality to the sustains as a result of this aural effect. After realising this, I decided to compose these effects into the piece by finding harmonies and textures which would provoke them.

Using EBows on the piano can be a challenge, as other composers have found. The strings to be a low-tension enough to be able to vibrate by the effects of a magnetic field, yet not so thick that they are too heavy to move. This limits the range over which you can place them on the piano. The results are slightly different for different pianos too. After much experimentation, I settled on a range of C4 - REFERENCE.



## Musical structure

 I've been working with on idea of designing a _musical surface_, rather than accepting a 'surface' (here taken to mean the totality of the sounding result) as a consequence of other design processes. Composing this way is a bit like sculpting a large block of granite in order to unconvering the form. It's subtractive. In this music, different parts of the surface fades in and out of focus over time. Harmonic centres of importance are spread over the piece so that they become exposed and then gradually subside throughout the piece. Here's a visualisation:

### Organisation

_Frozen Reflection Sleeping Buffalo_  has two sections.  In the first, small, isolated moments are set against a continuity of delicate drones provided by the Ebows. Tiny changes in the resonance of the decay occur as the ebow drones interfere with the other pitches to produce modulation artefacts. In order to design these more carefully than in my initial experiements, I needed to model these acoustic effects in Open Music (see below).

 The second section is a reversal, or reflection of the first in almost every way. Instead of building harmony on top of drone-like resonances as previously, I wanted to gradually fill out the negative-space around the drone-sounds is inverted with dense, angular chromatic writing.

The piano chords appear to take on a transparent, shimmering quality during these silences-in-sound.

### Tunnel Mountain
The sleeping buffalo legend suggests that Tunnel mountain, Banff, is a sacred place. It is a place where people come to share knowledge and discover new bonds to their surroundings and culture. Then they leave.
