# Architecture 3


After having created Architecture 1, where the aim was to embed something of the acoustic of the Guildhall in York -  the which the piece would be performed - into the score itself, and Architecture 2 - a piece created bespoke to show what a re-construction of a historic building which now does not exist - sounds like, architecture 3 concept created something of a challenge. 

Architecture 3 aims to take the augmented reality experience even further by enabling parts in the work to be individually substituted for one another, making the work performance.
